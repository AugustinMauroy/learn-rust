# learn rust

My self-learning journey of Rust programming language.

## Build & run an program

```bash
cd x-hello-world
rustc main.rs
./main
```

## Clean

When you want to clean all the `main` executables, you can run the following command:

```bash
rm -rf ./**/main
```

## Format

```bash
rustfmt ./**/main.rs
```
